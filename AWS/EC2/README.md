            Deploy Jankins on AWS

I launched an EC2 instance on AWS, which provides virtual servers in the cloud. I connected to the instance using SSH and configured key components such as instance type, security groups, and key pairs.

Next, I deployed a simple web application Jenkins on the EC2 instance. After installation and configuration, I was able to access Jenkins from outside AWS using the instanceâ€™s public IP address through port 8080.
