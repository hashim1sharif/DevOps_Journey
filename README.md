# DevOps Journey 

This repository documents my learning path toward becoming a DevOps Engineer.
It includes hands-on projects and technical notes covering topics such as cloud infrastructure, automation, Linux administration, networking, and continuous integration.

My objective is to develop the skills required to design and maintain reliable, automated, and scalable infrastructure systems.  
Although I am currently studying DevOps Engineering, all examples and projects in this repository are based on practical implementations that reflect real-world workflows.


## About Me

I am a DevOps engineer in training with a strong foundation in Linux, networking, Docker, and AWS.  
Through independent projects, I have gained experience with Infrastructure as Code, automation, and CI/CD pipelines.  
I am particularly interested in system reliability, infrastructure automation, and the integration of development and operations processes.


## Learning Focus

- **Linux and Bash** – system administration, shell scripting, process management  
- **Networking** – subnets, routing, DNS, firewalls, and security groups  
- **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)** – EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Route53  
- **Containers** – Docker and docker-compose for application deployment  
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform and AWS CLI automation  
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment** – GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment  
- **Monitoring and Logging** – introductory work with Prometheus and system metrics  


## Technical Skills

**Operating Systems:** Linux  
**Languages / Scripting:** Bash  
**Tools & Platforms:** Docker, Terraform, AWS CLI, GitHub Actions  
**Core Concepts:** Networking, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Cloud Automation  


## Current Development Goals

- Build a complete CI/CD pipeline connecting GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS EC2  
- Extend infrastructure automation with Terraform modules and state management  
- Gain deeper knowledge of container orchestration and Kubernetes fundamentals  
- Improve observability skills using monitoring and logging tools  


## Long-Term Vision

My long-term goal is to design and deploy production-grade cloud infrastructure that follows best practices for security, scalability, and automation.

The architecture below represents my end goal a fully automated, high-availability AWS environment built with Terraform, integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous delivery, and monitored through CloudWatch.

## This architecture showcases:

A multi-AZ VPC with public and private subnets

Load balancing and auto-scaling for ECS services

Secure data persistence using RDS PostgreSQL and ElastiCache Redis

Automated deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions

Infrastructure provisioning and management with Terraform


## Final Note

This repository serves as both a record of my technical learning and a demonstration of my ability to apply DevOps principles in practical scenarios.  
I continuously update it as I complete new projects and explore advanced DevOps technologies.  
Constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement are always appreciated 🙌.
