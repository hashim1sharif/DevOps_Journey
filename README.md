# DevOps Journey 

This repository documents my learning path toward becoming a DevOps Engineer.  
It includes hands-on projects and technical notes covering topics such as cloud infrastructure, automation, Linux administration, networking, and continuous integration.

My objective is to develop the skills required to design and maintain reliable, automated, and scalable infrastructure systems.  
Although I am currently studying DevOps Engineering, all examples and projects in this repository are based on practical implementations that reflect real-world workflows.

## About Me

I am a DevOps engineer in training with a strong foundation in Linux, networking, Docker, and AWS.  
Through independent projects, I have gained experience with Infrastructure as Code, automation, and CI/CD pipelines.  
I am particularly interested in system reliability, infrastructure automation, and the integration of development and operations processes.

## Learning Focus

- **Linux and Bash** – system administration, shell scripting, process management  
- **Networking** – subnets, routing, DNS, firewalls, and security groups  
- **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)** – EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Route53  
- **Containers** – Docker and docker-compose for application deployment  
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform and AWS CLI automation  
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment** – GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment  
- **Monitoring and Logging** – introductory work with Prometheus and system metrics
