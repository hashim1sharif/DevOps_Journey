# ðŸš€ Sorting Arrays I - Challenges

Welcome to the **Sorting Challenges** folder! This repository contains a collection of problems designed to help you practice and apply various sorting algorithms. 

### ðŸ“‹ Problem Checklist
Here are some sorting-related problems for you to tackle. **Remember:** The goal of these challenges is to implement the sorting algorithms we've learned rather than using pre-built sorting functions. I recommend practicing all four sorting algorithms and not just one!

1. [Sort the People](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/description/)
2. [Relative Sort Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/description/)
3. [Pancake Sorting](https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting/description/)
4. [Find Target Indices After Sorting Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-target-indices-after-sorting-array/description/)
5. [Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/description/)
6. [How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/how-many-numbers-are-smaller-than-the-current-number/description/)

### ðŸ“– Tips for Success
- **Understand the Algorithms**: Make sure you understand how each sorting algorithm works before attempting the problems.
- **Practice Different Algorithms**: Try to solve each problem using multiple sorting algorithms to deepen your understanding.
- **Review Your Solutions**: After completing a problem, review your solution and consider how you could optimize it further.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
