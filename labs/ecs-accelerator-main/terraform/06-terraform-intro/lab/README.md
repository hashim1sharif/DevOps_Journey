# Mini Lab – Terraform + Docker

Goal

Use Terraform to:

- Pull a Docker image
- Run a container locally
- Expose a port

This uses the same Terraform workflow we’ll later apply to AWS.

### Run the Lab

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Visit:

http://localhost:8080


Destroy when done:

terraform destroy
