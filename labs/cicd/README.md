# DevOps Journey — Hashim Sharif

Hi, I’m Hashim — a DevOps engineer in training with strong knowledge of Linux, networking, Docker, and AWS.  
I created this repository to document my learning journey and build practical, hands-on projects that reflect real DevOps and infrastructure work.  
My goal is to apply what I’ve learned to professional environments, like a System and Network Engineer role, where I can grow and contribute to reliable, automated systems.
